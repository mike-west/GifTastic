# GifTastic
This fun assignment uses the GIPHY api to produce a webpage of static and animated gifs. The theme is racing, mostly motor racing but other forms of racing too.

## How to use it
Click a one of the buttons at the top and a group of related, static gifs will be shown. Click any gif to animate it. Click it again to stop the animation and return to a static gif.

## Adding a racer
In the input form, enter the name of another racing theme or racer (i.e. Danica Patrick). Click enter and a button with that name will appear at the top. Click that button to show a list of gifs related to the button.

## How it's made
The web page was created using JQuery and Bootstrap in both the HTML and Javascript code. CSS is minimal and used for font sizes and button margins. Ajax was used to call the Giphy api.
